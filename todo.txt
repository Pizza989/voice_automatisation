Request Cycle:
    + detection
    + recognition
    + interpretation
    + execution

Generics:
    + audio buffers as numpy arrays with sample rate of 16000Hz

command:
    + identifier
    + execute

todo:
    + enhance voice activity detection using either a signal processing based approach (mel spectogram) or a deep learning approach
    + make speech recognition faster (maybe look for coqui ai models/german exclusive models/not an asr model)
      https://github.com/uhh-lt/kaldi-tuda-de, https://github.com/speechcatcher-asr/speechcatcher, https://alphacephei.com/
    + maybe use an approach like https://github.com/NeuralNine/neuralintents/blob/master/neuralintents for interpretation

problems:
    + right now if in voice_automatisation/__init__.py the config is not being imported first the application crashes fix this
    
    + when running the container, after or rather during the call to load the model the output to stdin stops for some reason 
      but the code still runds bc after terminating the controller via a keyboardinterrupt all the missing output is suddenly printed
