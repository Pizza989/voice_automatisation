Request Cycle:
    + detection
    + recognition
    + interpretation
    + execution

Generics:
    + audio buffers as numpy arrays with sample rate of 16000Hz

device_selection:
    + allow user to select a device

detection:
    + listen to mic and monitor volume
    + if volume above a threshold start recording
    + stop recording if some logic applies
    + enqueue recording as numpy array

recognition:
    + get buffer from queue
    + do recognition using whisper
    + add recognised text to queue

interpretation:
    + get text from queue
    + get command for text
    + add command to queue

execution:
    + get command from queue
    + execute command

command:
    + identifier
    + execute
