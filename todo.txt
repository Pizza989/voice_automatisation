Request Cycle:
    + detection
    + recognition
    + interpretation
    + execution

Generics:
    + audio buffers as numpy arrays with sample rate of 16000Hz

command:
    + identifier
    + execute

todo:
    + enhance voice activity detection using either a signal processing based approach (mel spectogram) or a deep learning approach
    + make speech recognition faster (maybe look for coqui ai models/german exclusive models/not an asr model)

    + maybe use an approach like https://github.com/NeuralNine/neuralintents/blob/master/neuralintents for interpretation
